### Materials for online RCC workshop "Guide to Generative Adversarial Networks"
July 28th, 2020

#### Abstract: 
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures using two neural networks that pit one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data.  They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation.  This workshop will expose participants to the base of GAN algorithms through hands-on experience in developing and using GANs on popular image datasets.
#### Objectives:
Participants will learn/do during the workshop:
* Basic idea and intuition behind works of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Implementing a GAN-based model that generates data from public image datasets
* Visualizing and analyzing different aspects of the GAN to better understand what’s happening behind the scenes
* Evaluating the performance of the GAN and using the final standalone generator model to generate new images.

#### Level: Intermediate
#### Duration: 2 hours
#### Prerequisites: 
All participants are expected to bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system that they have administrative privileges on and ensure internet availability. Having prior programming experience, particularly in Python and deep learning, is helpful but not required. An RCC account is helpful but not required.
